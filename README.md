# Team 11-4 Computational Structures 1D Arcade Game: Whack-a-Mole!

Started with these constraints we set for ourselves:
- a few physical buttons
- makes use of an arithmetic logic that has a boolean, addition, comparison and multiplier function
- these buttons each contain a built-in led, which will light up, signalling the user to press. more than 1 button can light up together 

Ended up with a rendition of the classic "whack-a-mole game" which has 3 buttons to be pressed around the same time when they light up.
